# Depth-First Search

- Traverse all items.
- Find path(s)

Normally use `stack` or `recursion`, as `stack` is first in last out.

## Time/Space Complxity

|Type|Time|Space|
|----|----|-----|
|Graph|Depends on `Edge`. If a permutation can be `n!` such as [332. Reconstruct Itinerary](../Solutions/332_Reconstruct_Itinerary/README.md)|Depends on `Edge`(Buid Graph by HashMap)|
|2D Array|`m*n` for a single path|`m*n` to store a path and `visited`|
|Binary Tree|Tree `Depth`, worst case can be `n` if it is a single branch tree|Tree `Depth`, worst case can be `n` if it is a single branch tree|
